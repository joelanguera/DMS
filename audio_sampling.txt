Sample Format
=============
The number of bits used to describe each sample.
Common formats are 16 and 24 bits.


Sample Rate
===========
The sample rate is the number of samples played in each second.
Common sample rates are 44.1 kHz, 48 kHz and 96 kHz.


Bit Rate
========
It's the number of bits in a given time period.
Usually measured in kilobits per second ("kbps" or "kb/s").
To calculate the bit rate, multiply the sample rate and the sample
format:
	The bit rate of an audio CD (705.6kb/s) is the sample rate
	(44.1 kHz) multiplied by the sample format (16 bits).
